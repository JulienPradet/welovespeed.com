title: "HTTP/3: it's a transport issue!"
description: >-
  HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is the Web protocol. The announcement of HTTP/3 in early November 2018 surprised many people: the time gap between HTTP/3 and HTTP/2 was less than 4 years, whereas 18 years had passed between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.


  Nevertheless, this version brings a real complementarity to the work achieved by HTTP/2, especially on latency issues.


  Latency is certainly the number one enemy of Web Performance. It can be found at all levels: front-end, back-end, network protocol, hardware, etc. Latency must therefore be tackled in a comprehensive way to provide users with the best possible experience.


  This talk will come back to the reasons for this 3rd version of the Web protocol, what it brings and what it changes, and what web developers can expect from it.


  It will also be an opportunity to present the challenges that will arise when implementing HTTP/3.


  The target audience is anyone with a technical background working around the web (developer, devops, network engineer).


  The main lines of the intervention will be:

  - the notions of latency and bandwidth

  - the latency problem related to TCP + TLS

  - the introduction of the QUIC transport protocol to solve these problems

  - limitations imposed by TCP over HTTP/2

  - the challenges regarding the implementation of HTTP/3

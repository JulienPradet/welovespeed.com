title: "Honey, I Shrunk the JS Bundles"
description: >-
  Working on a web applications for the advisors of a large bank, we faced performance problems caused by the large quantity of JavaScript we were sending our users.


  We managed to reduce the load time of our app from 9 to 2 seconds, using several methods: bundle analysis, code splitting and dependency deduplication.

  During this talk, I’ll talk about the following topics:

  - Easy splitting your JavaScript bundle

  - Analyzing and monitoring the quantity of JavaScript

  - Deduping your dependencies

  - Choosing the right dependencies

  - Code splitting vs. bundle splitting


  I will illustrate those topics with their concrete impact on our web application’s performance.


  By the end of this talk, you will know the best practices to keep your JavaScript size as low as possible, and will have access to training materials that I wrote that will help make you experts on the topic.

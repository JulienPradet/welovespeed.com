title: "Feedback on 4 years of XP using a Synthetic Monitoring tool at SeLoger"
description: >-
  A few years ago, SeLoger invested heavily in the application performance of its websites. This resulted in jobs creation, the tools purchasing and the creation of an custom-made Synthetic Monitoring solution based on WebPageTest. Today we have migrated to a commercial product.


  During this conference, you will first discover why and how we created a Synthetic Monitoring solution by ourselves. We will answer the following questions.

  - Why we didn't take a tool from the market?

  - How we designed it?

  - How and why we have improved it?

  - How we used it internally to create a culture, a web-performance oriented standard?


  Then, in a second phase, why and how we carried out the migration:


  - Why abandon a custom solution?

  - What are the impacts on our projects?

  - What choices did we make throughout the process?

  - What have we learned?

  - What are the pitfalls to avoid?

  - What compromises have we accepted?


  I will start by presenting the context to SeLoger and our late Synthetic Monitoring solution. Then we will proceed with the selection process we have put in place.

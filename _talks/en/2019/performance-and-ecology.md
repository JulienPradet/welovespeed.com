title: "How to link performance and ecology?"
description: >-
  The Web must be fast, optimized and efficient. But achieving a high-performance website is not easy when you consider the ecological aspects of the resulting code or the additional servers on your infrastructure. Web Performance is not <code>Green</code>, but it could be.


  During this talk, I'll explain the ecological impacts of digital technology and those specifically added by some Web performance optimizations so that you know how to embrace them. Together, let's build a fast, efficient <strong>and responsible</strong> web.

title: "Responsible JavaScript"
description: >-
  While the performance of JavaScript engines in browsers have seen continued improvement, the amount of JavaScript we serve increases unabated. We need to use JavaScript more responsibly, which means we must rely on native browser features where prudent, use HTML and CSS when appropriate, and know when too much JavaScript is just that: too much.


  In this talk, we'll explore what happens to performance and accessibility when devices are inundated with more JavaScript than they can handle. We'll also dive into some novel techniques you can use to tailor delivery of scripts with respect to a person's device capabilities and network connection quality. When you walk out of this session, you'll be equipped with new knowledge to make your sites as fast as they are beautiful.

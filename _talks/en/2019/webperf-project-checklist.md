title: "Webperf optimization project: what are we getting into?"
description: >-
  Do you want to launch or are you in the process of launching a Web Performance optimization project?

  Let's discuss together the different stages of maturation of a webperf project in a company through the feedback of OUI.sncf, but also from other e-commerce sites that have had the same approach.

  During this presentation, we will discuss:


  - The preconditions for launching a webperf project (what triggers or arguments can make you aware of the need to launch such a project?);

  - Preparation (who to surround yourself with, how to organize yourself?);

  - Skills development (how to approach the learning phase, set objectives, review your monitoring);

  - Obstacles (what posture to adopt in cases of divergent interests);

  - The maturity phase (sensitize teams more broadly, determine the relays of acculturation);

  - And of course, the end (when can we say that an optimization project is finished?).

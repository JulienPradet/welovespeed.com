title: "How to make sense of real user metrics (RUM)"
description: >-
  Thanks to client-side APIs like NavigationTiming, we can collect a lot of information about the real performance experienced by users. However, the organic nature of this data introduces many pitfalls when it comes to interpreting them. 


  We will look at best practices, real life examples from Wikipedia’s production traffic and recent research we’ve done on this subject. 

  We will attempt to answer which of these metrics matter the most. 

  Finally, we will take a tour of exciting new RUM metrics being worked on at the W3C Web Performance working group and share our experience testing them on Wikipedia with Google Origin Trials.

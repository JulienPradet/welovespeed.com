title: "Reduce the weight of a mail client UI via CSS&#8239;/&#8239;SVG"
description: >-
  I’m currently working on the v4 of ProtonMail. The present version is not always easy to operate: the technical debt is inevitable (and performance debt as well), so are heavy CSS and lack of consistency…


  Revamping is an ideal opportunity to rethink the CSS architecture and take the right decisions to improve performance: significant earnings requires groundwork, and some choices that may appear as trivial could reveal themselves powerful when it’s about scaling and thinking about going worldwide.


  I’m sharing feedback about this long term work, tips such as SVG (because the most efficient requests are the ones… we don’t run :)), and more especially the way to conceive CSS architecture to drastically reduce its weight, in order to consider performance budget or critical CSS with perfect equanimity.


  You haven’t heard the last from HTML/CSS developpers!

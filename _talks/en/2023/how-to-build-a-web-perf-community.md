title: "How to Build a Web Perf Community in Your Organization?"
subtitle: ~
excerpt: "Why, who, with what, how and for what results should you build a community around Web Performance? La Redoute's experience."
description: >-
  We propose to share our feedback on the implementation of our WebPerf Community within La Redoute.


  The overall plan is as follows:

  - Why build a WebPerf community 

  - Which actors to include (the art of not forgetting all the components necessary for the committee to be really efficient and useful)

  - What tools / indicators to rely on (Example and sharing of our tools)

  - What animation and objectives (Example of minutes of our committees and a specific use case of animation on the CLS following a major problem after our visual identity change)

  - What results were obtained after one year of implementation

  - Our next steps / challenges

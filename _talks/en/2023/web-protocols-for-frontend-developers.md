description: >-
  HTTP/3 is here, and it promises major performance benefits! Most of these we get for free, with just the flip of a switch. Some however allow or even require tweaking by (frontend) developers for optimal performance.


  In this talk, we'll look at the high-level options you as a developer have to steer HTTP/2 and 3 behaviour, and how those actually work internally. We'll consider preloading, lazy loading and fetchpriority/priority hints. We take a critical look at keeping your core HTML/CSS smaller than 14KB in the 0-RTT era. And we'll also discuss the new hotness of 103 Early Hints, aka ""Server Push Killer"".


  Combining networking 101, protocol history, and especially practical tips, you'll learn what's happening under the hood and how to tune it yourself.

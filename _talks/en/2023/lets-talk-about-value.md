title: "Let's Talk About Value"
subtitle: ~
excerpt: >-
  The best practices of web performance are consensual and widely accepted, but how can we value them from a business point of view?
description: >-
  I spent 15 years explaining to my clients why it was necessary to respect this or that good development practice. Like many, I relied on authority, citing studies conducted by this or that major company, but without necessarily having the ability to project or measure the value of the optimizations I was proposing. 


  I now have access to more data. And I'm eager to share with you what I've learned about the value of our work and why it should be crucial to embed these thoughts in all digital/marketing structures.

  > Knowing accessibility to code well. Don't learn to code well to do accessibility.


  Is accessibility a simple theoretical overlay to have a compliant code? Not quite.

  Most accessibility audits show very low scores of compliance with the <abbr title="Référentiel général d’amélioration de l’accessibilité" lang="fr">RGAA</abbr> (which is a not very demanding standard). These audits reveal technical problems but also design and organization problems and especially a lack of web culture.


  But then, couldn't increasing the web culture in a team also benefit performance improvement? Couldn't correcting accessibility anomalies improve page load times?


  Let's take a step aside to see the webperf from another angle and see what accessibility could bring to it.

title: "SEO and Web Performance, Whatâ€™s the Deal?"
subtitle: ~
excerpt: >-
  Why is Web Performance truely important for SEO (and it's not necessarily what you think)
description: >-
  We will first discuss the impact of code download times on crawling and crawling behavior, and we will challenge some of the conventional wisdom (such as the 500ms or 200ms average time target).

  Then we will discuss the impact of bad rendition times in CSR on crawling and indexing, and we will explain the points to watch out for when we are at the limit (attention to the CPU load, to the resources consumed etc...).

  Finally we will see what is the real impact of bad Core Web Vitals on rankings (in practice: it is a nudge from Google. The "Page Experience" indicators are only used to break the tie in the rankings).

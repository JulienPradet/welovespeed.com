  The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and so is web performance.

  In more than 10 years spent optimizing sites, St√©phane Rios, founder and CEO of Fasterize, has seen a lot. And as it doesn't only happen to others, he testifies about the pitfalls in which many sites have fallen and still fall: images, lazyload, sprites, defer, preload / preconnect, inlining, etc. ... everything goes!

  All these actions were of course motivated by the desire to improve performance, but things did not go as planned. In short, applying good practices stupidly is not enough, you need a real intelligence (not artificial) to optimize a site.

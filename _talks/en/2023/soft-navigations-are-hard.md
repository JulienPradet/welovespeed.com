  Are Single Page Apps faster? Let's discuss new technologies in the web browser that allow us to measure performance metrics for SPAs.
description: >-
  For over a decade now, the web community has been asking the question, "Are Single Page Apps faster?"


  The arguments on each side are based mostly on a mixture of belief and anecdote, since we didn't have the data to answer these questions. Until now.


  In this talk, we will discuss new technologies in the web browser that allow us to measure performance metrics for Single Page Apps in the same way as for Multipage Apps. We'll look at their functionality, how they work, and how you can use them to improve the performance of your SPA.

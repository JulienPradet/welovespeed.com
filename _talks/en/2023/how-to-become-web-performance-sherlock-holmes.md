subtitle: ~

  Let's use Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's diagnostic techniques to solve the mysteries of web performance.
description: >-
  If you work in the world of web performance, you know that we can be confronted with complex problems. How do we speed up the experience of users with slow-loading pages, not speed up the browsing experience of those who already have the best display speed?


  What if we used proven methods to solve them?  

  As the creator of the famous "Sherlock Holmes method", we will see how Sir Arthur Conan Doyle will help us explore a systematic diagnostic methodology applicable to web performance.


  With this approach, you will be able to identify and solve technical problems with ease. Using real-world examples, you'll learn how to collect data, analyze the results, and formulate a strategy to solve the problems. 


  Topics Covered:

  - Introduction to Sherlock's method: observation, deduction, abduction, evaluation, verification and communication  
  - Concrete application to web performance:  

    - Observation: good practice of observability tools, contextualization of incidents, statistical analysis of Web Core Vitals contributors.
    - Deduction: good knowledge of the rendering cycle and its consequences
    - ...

  - Presentation of several practical cases:

    - LCP degradation on a particular segment of the audience 
    - Identification of user interactions
    - ...


  If you need to design an optimization plan, or if you monitor your site's performance on a daily basis for the slightest regression, this presentation is for you.

title: "Chrome UX Report"
description: >-
  Understanding how fast your website is as experienced by real users is a critical first step to begin to optimize performance. But there has been a blind spot in our performance toolbox. Until recently, there hasn't been a way to compare your website's real user performance against your competitors. Having this data is critical to benchmarking your competitive edge.


  The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report/ "Chrome User Experience Report"" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chrome UX Report</a> is a one-of-a-kind dataset that makes these kinds of insights available, so that you can put your performance into perspective. In this talk we will explore how it works and how you can leverage it to better understand the user experience on the web.

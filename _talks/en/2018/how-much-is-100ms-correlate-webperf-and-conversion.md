title: "How much is 100ms?"
description: >-
  Fighting against milliseconds, megabytes or dozens of tags is what webperf addicts do every day and it is obviously a necessity for our beloved Internet users. But the reason that we all work in this ecosystem, is that Amazon has one day put figures on the business impacts that this work had (100ms, etc. you know? ;-). Since then, dozens and dozens of studies have shown with varying degrees of success the correlation between webperf and business.


  I propose you to go beyond this notion of correlation and to present methods to measure concretely what is the impact of the webperf on your Web site: distributions, A/B tests, Chi2 tests, etc... but also to illustrate this with real cases met during my long life as Webperf expert.

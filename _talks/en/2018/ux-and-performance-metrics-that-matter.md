title: "User Experience & Performance: Metrics that Matter"
description: >-
  Whenever we speak about measuring web performance and user experience, we typically refer to static events in the browsing experience.  Modern websites, however, are far from static, and user interactions with these websites have continuous aspects that cannot be represented by distinct events.


  Over the last 10 years, our little OpenSource team has been working to build a JavaScript library, called boomerang, that measures all the performance aspects of real user experience.


  In this talk, we’ll look at some of the new user experience metrics that the boomerang team has been collecting. We’ll find out how to measure page responsiveness, smoothness, jank, and usability. We’ll learn about things like Rage Clicks, Missed Clicks, and Dead Clicks. We’ll also look at real user data that we’ve collected showing how these aspects of the page affect user behaviour.


  JavaScript provides us with many hooks into measuring performance and user experience. Let’s learn to collect them and understand what to expect when we optimize for them.

title: "Eventually: how to measure web performance?"
description: >-
  The page loading time is (very often) silly. Other generic and much better metrics exist but each have their weaknesses (speedIndex, first contentful paint, Time to Interactive â€¦). So, I'm going to teach you how to measure what really counts for YOUR website: technical loading metrics, visual metrics, client CPU and custom metrics.

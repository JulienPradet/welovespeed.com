title: "Optimize performance by selecting optimal dimensions of responsive images"
description: >-
  The use of recent standards for responsive images (mainly `srcset-w`) has become unavoidable, but is not always accompanied by a fundamental reflection on their proper use.


  To be more specific, too many sites use arbitrary image sizes in their `srcset-w`s, neglecting a significant performance optimization opportunity.


  We will discuss different methods to define the best possible dimensions for these images, which will optimize performance for visitors, but also optimize the amount of computation, storage and bandwidth required on the server side.


  Please note that this conference will not deal with optimal compression rates, image encoding formats or solutions that automate the management of all these optimizations.

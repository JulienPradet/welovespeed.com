title: "Web Performance, a concrete utopia?"
description: >-
  Web Performance is often perceived as a very technical subject, sometimes disconnected from business concerns. In this short presentation, I want to show that Web Performance is on the contrary a domain rooted in real-life experience of the web, to address with hindsight and pragmatism.

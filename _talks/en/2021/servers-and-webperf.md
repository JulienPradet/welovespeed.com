title: "Web server and Webperf seen by an SEO"
excerpt: >-
  Improving your server response time is one of the basics of web performance. Tips and tricks for a better TTFB, seen by a SEO.
description: >-
  Let's talk about web server configuration (Apache/Nginx) and elements that can impact certain KPIs (e.g. TTFB).  Having done a lot of SEO migrations, I have often encountered several issues in terms of 301 redirects and server configuration. A degraded TTFB can also have an impact on high volume sites on the Google crawl (crawl budget).


  During this presentation, I will talk about optimizations that can ease the server response time on Apache/Nginx, SEO oriented HTTP headers, and the advantages / disadvantages of some modules related to the Webperf on Apache/Nginx.

title: "LCP – Deep Dive"
excerpt: You know the LCP but… do you? Let's discuss the history and the way this constantly evolving metric works.
description: >-
  Largest Contentful Paint (or LCP) is the visual loading performance metric that is part of the Core Web Vitals. LCP measures the time it takes for your web page to load the largest image or text element and show it to the user.


  But why do we measure the largest element? How is user interaction handled? Progressive loading of images? What about videos?


  In this presentation, we will cover the history of LCP, why this metric was chosen as a representative of visual loading, its definition, how it has evolved to the present day, and how it continues to evolve.

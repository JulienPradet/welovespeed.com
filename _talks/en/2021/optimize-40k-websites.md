title: "How to improve the web performance of a portfolio of over 40,000 sites?"
excerpt: >-
  How to optimize web performance when you are in charge of tens of thousands of websites for small and medium-sized businesses?
description: >-
  Optimizing the Web Vitals is part of a larger plan of Solocal's website division, aiming to considerably improve the performance, design and quality of our content, in order to improve local SEO for the hundreds of websites we produce every week for our small and medium-sized business customers.


  In addition to strengthening the UX, Design and SEO teams, the company has, for the past 3 years, modernized its technological stack by formalizing a partnership with the company Duda, editor of an eponymous CMS available as a SaaS offer.


  In this presentation, we will address the subject of web performance optimization from three angles.


  1. The evolutions undertaken by Duda to optimize CWV, illustrated by field data on the evolution for the entire Duda portfolio, with a particular focus on the Solocal websites.

  2. The challenges we encountered at Solocal during the migration of our sites, which were previously hosted and operated in-house on technological platforms that were not adapted to these new challenges.

  3. Perspective for the evolution of the Duda platform in order to continuously improve web performance, and feedback on its management, in the context of Solocal's mass production of sites.

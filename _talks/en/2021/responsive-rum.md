title: "Responsive RUM"
excerpt: >-
  A successful performance analysis requires the proper categorization of the collected measurements by device type. Overview of the available techniques.
description: >-
  Categorizing device types by desktop, mobile and tablet no longer works in 2021.

  It is oversimplified, meaningless and likely breaks your current performance analysis on a modern responsive website.


  As #perfmatters we need meaningful monitoring that takes into account the modern web:


  - Screen dimensions

  - Device pixel ratios

  - Image and CSS breakpoints

  - Connections


  Keeping it both simple and meaningful is however not easy!

  Learn about the different approaches and how to apply this to your existing RUM monitoring solutions: be it free (Google Analytics), open source (Boomerang) or commercial.

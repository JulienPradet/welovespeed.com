title: "Micro-Front architecture, a driver for web performance?"
excerpt: >-
  A feedback on the use of the Micro-Front architecture at Leroy Merlin. Time to Market, performance, resilience, we'll tell you everything!
description: >-
  Micro-front architecture is increasingly being promoted in large companies, but there is very little feedback on webperf issues (multiplication of API calls, code duplication, increased number of resources, etc.).


  To address the issues of time to market, performance and resilience, Leroy Merlin chose in 2017 to redesign its website based on a micro-front-end architecture. We started with a blank sheet of paper and addressed from the beginning and as a single topic the back and front performance issues.


  We offer you a feedback and will explain the concepts we implemented to make the micro-front architecture an ally of webperf.

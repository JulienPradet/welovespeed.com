title: Critical path optimization
subtitle: "How to accelerate your performance?"
exceprt: >-
  When does the first rendering of a page occur? How to identify and optimize blockages? How to anticipate rendering problems? Examples, techniques and tools to better master the critical path.
description: >-
  Often present in various Web optimization tools, the critical path is a concept that is poorly understood or ignored. When does the first rendering of a page occur? How to identify and optimize blockages? These are the questions I want to answer.


  To be interested in the critical path is to dive into the functioning of browsers and the construction of the HTML page. To optimize it is to know very different techniques of layout and prioritization on the resources essential to the display of the first pixel. The critical path is the bottleneck of the application.


  For this reason, improving the critical path means anticipating many performance problems (FP, LCP, Speed index, FID).


  My goal is to present, with concrete and quantified examples, the most efficient techniques I could experiment to reduce the number and size of critical resources: caching policies, js and css minification and prioritization, font management... 

  In addition to the diagnosis, I will talk about the most adapted monitoring tools available on the market.

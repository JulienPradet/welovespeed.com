title: "Partnering around web performance"
subtitle: "an SEO & Dev approach"
excerpt: >-
  Web Performance brings together different expertises around common projects. Flashback on an ambitious transverse project at Fabernovel.
description: >-
  Web Perf meets multiple challenges (SEO, CSR, performance), which are often handled by teams with different expertise. This compartmentalization contributes to having only a partial understanding of the subject. Taking advantage of a common web performance audit opportunity for one of our clients, Fabernovel's SEO and dev teams have initiated a global approach focused on web performance, under which these different expertises are grouped. This conference will be an opportunity to discuss the lessons we have learned from this collaboration through concrete examples.

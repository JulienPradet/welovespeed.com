title: "SPArtacUX, the project that brought web performance to the heart of ManoMano UX"
excerpt: >-
  Feedback on the revamping of ManoMano. Starting from scratch to become a reference in terms of site speed, what a challenge!
description: >-
  March 2020, first lockdown, stores are closed, people are DIYing... Consequence: explosion of the ManoMano website traffic. Boosted by several reflections before the crisis, we take the decision to start from scratch to make the ManoMano website a reference in terms of performance. I will share with you how we chose and implemented the new technical stack in record time, and why combining experience and performance can be complex.

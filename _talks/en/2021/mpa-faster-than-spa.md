title: "Faster Than SPAs?"
excerpt: >-
  Do SPAs deliver on their promise? Let's take a look at how to get such rich interactions on multipage architectures, without needing hundreds of KB of JavaScript.
description: >-
  Single Page Apps architectures are very popular. These architectures are notorious for not delivering fast sites on the first visit. In exchange for this slow start, they promise superior performance for subsequent interactions. Is this really the case?


  Looking at existing sites using Single Page Apps, we'll see that the promise of the super fast second page is not as simple as it seems. Then, if we decide to go with a Multi Page Apps architecture, how do we code the moments of interactivity within the same screen? We will look at how to respond to user interaction and load content dynamically without needing several hundred KB of JavaScript.
